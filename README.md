1. How do I approach designing software?
      Software is a tool that allows one to more easily accomplish something. For many programs, it accomplishes a task faster than a human can do it alone. For games, it allows greater forms of entertainment with less effort on the user's behalf. This computer science class has taught me more about modeling than I had any clue about before. I now know how to create custom shape meshes, light them, texture them, provide materials with varying reflectiveness, move them around a scene, and even change their size in various ways. When I wanted to design something for the scene I created, I started with where I wanted everything to be first, then I worried about their size, material, and textures. Lighting was easy to solve if I wanted it to stay put. Using these same tactics should make creating scenes in the future easier to accomplish.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
       Developing the code for these projects wasn't as simple as I had first thought. Where I had to put them could be confusing at times, and I often had to tweak certain values to get the result I wanted. Placing functions in different locations and files within my projects allowed me to organize it better, and I will definitely have to use this method in the future. I was constantly iterating on this code, changing values when previous changes I made created conflict with how I wanted my scene to look. My approach to coding only became more clear as the milestones passed by, since the same methods I've been using have been reinforced through practice.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
       Computer science helps us navigate computers to achieve things we could not do before, or to do it much easier than before. These skills I've developed through years of computer science classes will help me further refine my skills in working with computers before I graduate, and will assist me in finding and building a career once afterward. Computational graphics and visualization will allow me to bring gui, 3D and 2D scenes to life in a way I could not imagine before. Knowing where an object needs to sit in a scene can be useful in a variety of ways, both professionally and personally.
